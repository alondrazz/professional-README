## Professional Readme

## I had to make a generated readme for people who have never used it before, I had to alo inlcude a step by step video.

## To install my code, you will have to copy my code and then clone it to your terminal, and to watch the video you have to click on the link.

## If you ever need help making a readme, you can follow along to my video, or if you need help generating one using node.js

## I had help using GitHub, connietran-dev, is the user I looked at and looking at how they did it and what questions they asked, my instructor also provided us with the starter code, and how to screen record.
